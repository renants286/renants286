🏃‍♂️🔧🚀 Passionate about Running, Technology, and Industry 4.0 🏃‍♂️🔧🚀

Hello, I'm Renan Tavares! I'm a Brazilian, holding a degree in Mechatronics from UTFPR, and a postgraduate degree in Production Engineering. A family man and a passionate road runner, I have an insatiable curiosity that leads me to explore the world of technology and Industry 4.0.

I've worked in the industrial sector for many years, spanning various segments and departments, with a notable presence in Industrial Maintenance, Industrial Automation, and Process Engineering.

I'm dedicated to developing hardware and software solutions primarily focused on IoT within the scope of Industry 4.0.

The determination that drives me in running competitions is also present in the quest for innovative solutions within the industry.

My GitHub is my creative space, where I combine my new skills (I'm continuously learning through courses in the Dev field) with my technological and industrial expertise.

I'm always open to new challenges and entrepreneurial opportunities. If you share any of my passions, let's connect and open a channel for collaboration!
